# 🌱 What is a Goroutine?

A **goroutine** is a lightweight, independently executing function that runs **concurrently** with other goroutines in the same address space.
Think of it as:

* In **JavaScript**, we have an **event loop** that handles async tasks (e.g., promises, async/await).
* In **Go**, instead of a single-threaded event loop, we have **goroutines managed by the Go runtime**.

They allow us to perform tasks like handling requests, I/O operations, or computations in parallel **without manually managing threads**.

# ⚖️ Goroutine vs OS Thread

| Feature                   | Goroutine                        | OS Thread               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Size at start**         | ~2 KB stack                      | ~1 MB stack             |
| **Managed by**            | Go runtime scheduler (M:N model) | OS Kernel               |
| **Number you can create** | Millions                         | Limited (few thousands) |
| **Switching**             | Very fast, done in user space    | Slower, done by OS      |
| **Creation cost**         | Extremely cheap                  | Expensive               |

👉 This is why we say goroutines are *lightweight threads*.

# ⚙️ How to Start a Goroutine

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func printMessage(msg string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(msg, i)
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

func main() {
	go printMessage("goroutine") // runs concurrently
	printMessage("main")         // runs in main goroutine
}
```

* The `go` keyword starts a new goroutine.
* Here:

  * `main()` itself runs in the **main goroutine**.
  * `go printMessage("goroutine")` starts another goroutine.
* If `main()` exits before the new goroutine finishes, the program ends immediately.

⚠️ Unlike JavaScript promises (which keep the process alive until settled), Go doesn’t wait for goroutines unless you **explicitly synchronize** them.

---

# 🧵 Go’s Concurrency Model (M:N Scheduler)

Go runtime uses an **M:N scheduler**, meaning:

* **M goroutines** are multiplexed onto **N OS threads**.
* This is different from **1:1** (like Java threads) or **N:1** (like cooperative multitasking).

The scheduler ensures:

* Goroutines are distributed across multiple threads.
* When one blocks (e.g., waiting on I/O), another is scheduled.

Think of goroutines as **tasks in a work-stealing scheduler**.

---

# 🛠️ Synchronization with Goroutines

Since goroutines run concurrently, we need synchronization tools:

### 1. **WaitGroup** – Wait for Goroutines to Finish

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done() // signals completion
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
	// simulate work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)            // add to wait counter
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait() // wait for all to finish
}
```

✅ Ensures the program won’t exit before all goroutines finish.

---

### 2. **Channels** – Communication Between Goroutines

Channels are **Go’s big idea** for concurrency.
Instead of sharing memory and locking it, goroutines **communicate by passing messages**.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func worker(ch chan string) {
	ch <- "task finished" // send data into channel
}

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)

	go worker(ch)

	msg := <-ch // receive data
	fmt.Println("Message:", msg)
}
```

👉 Think of it like JavaScript `Promise.resolve("task finished")`, but **synchronous communication** unless buffered.

---

### 3. **Buffered Channels** – Queue of Messages

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2) // capacity = 2
ch <- 10
ch <- 20
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)
```

* Unbuffered channel: send blocks until receive is ready.
* Buffered channel: send doesn’t block until buffer is full.

---

### 4. **select** – Multiplexing Channels

```go
select {
case msg := <-ch1:
	fmt.Println("Received", msg)
case msg := <-ch2:
	fmt.Println("Received", msg)
default:
	fmt.Println("No message")
}
```

Like `Promise.race()` in JS.

---

# 🔥 Key Gotchas with Goroutines

1. **Main goroutine exit kills all child goroutines**.
   → Always use WaitGroups or channels to synchronize.

2. **Race conditions** happen if goroutines write/read shared data without sync.
   → Use `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, or better: **channels**.

3. **Too many goroutines** can cause memory pressure, but still far cheaper than threads.

4. **Don’t block forever** – unreceived channel sends cause deadlocks.

---

# 📊 Real-World Use Cases

* **Web servers**: Each request can run in its own goroutine.
* **Scraping / Crawling**: Launch a goroutine for each URL fetch.
* **Background jobs**: Run tasks concurrently (DB writes, logging, metrics).
* **Pipelines**: Process data in multiple stages with goroutines + channels.

---

# 🧠 Mental Model (JS vs Go)

* **JavaScript** → concurrency = single-threaded event loop + async callbacks.
* **Go** → concurrency = many goroutines scheduled onto multiple OS threads.

So:

* In JS, concurrency = illusion via async.
* In Go, concurrency = real, parallel execution when multiple CPU cores exist.

---

✅ To summarize:

* Goroutines = **cheap concurrent tasks** managed by Go runtime.
* Not OS threads, but multiplexed onto threads.
* Communicate via **channels** instead of shared memory.
* Powerful with **WaitGroups, select, and synchronization tools**.

---

**concurrency vs parallelism** is a core concept in computer science and in Go (since Go was built with concurrency in mind). Let’s break it down step by step in detail.

---

## **1. The Core Idea**

* **Concurrency** = Dealing with many tasks at once (managing multiple things).
* **Parallelism** = Doing many tasks at the same time (executing multiple things simultaneously).

Both sound similar, but they’re not the same.

---

## **2. Analogy**

Imagine we’re in a restaurant kitchen:

* **Concurrency (chef multitasking):**
  One chef handles multiple dishes by switching between them. He cuts vegetables for Dish A, stirs the sauce for Dish B, and checks the oven for Dish C. He’s *not doing them at the exact same time*, but he’s managing multiple tasks *in progress*.

* **Parallelism (many chefs working together):**
  Three chefs cook three different dishes at the *same time*. Tasks truly happen *simultaneously*.

👉 Concurrency is about **structure** (how tasks are managed).
👉 Parallelism is about **execution** (how tasks are run in hardware).

---

## **3. Technical Definition**

* **Concurrency**:
  Multiple tasks *make progress* in overlapping time periods. It doesn’t require multiple processors/cores. Even with a single CPU core, the system can *interleave execution* of tasks via context switching.

* **Parallelism**:
  Multiple tasks *run at the exact same instant*, usually on different CPU cores or processors.

---

## **4. Example with Go**

Go is famous for concurrency with **goroutines**.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func task(name string) {
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		fmt.Println(name, ":", i)
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

func main() {
	go task("Task A") // run concurrently
	go task("Task B")

	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Done")
}
```

### What happens:

* **Concurrency:** Both `Task A` and `Task B` *appear to run at the same time* because Go schedules goroutines across available cores. If you run this on a single-core CPU, Go interleaves execution → that’s concurrency.
* **Parallelism:** If you run this on a multi-core CPU, `Task A` might run on Core 1 and `Task B` on Core 2 simultaneously → that’s parallelism.

---

## **5. Key Differences Table**

| Aspect              | Concurrency                         | Parallelism                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Managing multiple tasks at once     | Executing multiple tasks at once               |
| **Focus**           | Task switching and scheduling       | Simultaneous execution                         |
| **CPU Requirement** | Can happen on a single-core CPU     | Requires multi-core CPU                        |
| **Analogy**         | One chef multitasking across dishes | Many chefs cooking different dishes            |
| **In Go**           | Achieved via goroutines & channels  | Achieved when goroutines run on multiple cores |

---

## **6. Visual Representation**

* **Concurrency (single-core):**

```
Time: |----A----|----B----|----A----|----B----|
       ^ Task A and Task B interleaved
```

* **Parallelism (multi-core):**

```
Core1: |----A----|----A----|----A----|
Core2: |----B----|----B----|----B----|
       ^ Tasks running truly at the same time
```

---

## **7. In Practice**

* Concurrency is **a design approach**: "How do we structure a program so that it can handle many things at once?"
* Parallelism is **an execution strategy**: "How do we use hardware to literally do many things at once?"

Go is *concurrent by design* (goroutines + channels) and *parallel by runtime* (GOMAXPROCS decides how many cores are used).

---

✅ **Final takeaway**:

* **Concurrency = composition of independently executing tasks.**
* **Parallelism = simultaneous execution of tasks.**

They are related, but not the same. A program can be concurrent but not parallel, parallel but not concurrent, or both.

---

Let’s go step by step and dive **deep into channels in Go**, because they’re one of the most powerful concurrency primitives in the language.

---

## 🔹 What are Channels in Go?

In Go, a **channel** is a **typed conduit** (pipe) through which goroutines can **communicate** with each other.

* They allow **synchronization** (ensuring goroutines coordinate properly).
* They allow **data exchange** between goroutines safely, without explicit locking (like mutexes).

👉 Think of a channel as a "queue" or "pipeline" where one goroutine can send data and another goroutine can receive it.

---

## 🔹 Syntax of Channels

### Declaring a channel

```go
var ch chan int // declare a channel of type int
```

### Creating a channel

```go
ch := make(chan int) // make allocates memory for a channel
```

Here:

* `ch` is a channel of integers.
* `make(chan int)` initializes it.

---

## 🔹 Sending and Receiving on Channels

We use the `<-` operator.

```go
ch <- 10       // send value 10 into channel
value := <-ch  // receive value from channel
```

* **Send (`ch <- value`)**: Puts data into the channel.
* **Receive (`value := <-ch`)**: Gets data from the channel.
* Both operations **block** until the other side is ready (unless buffered).

---

## 🔹 Example: Simple Goroutine Communication

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(ch chan string) {
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	ch <- "done" // send message
}

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)
	go worker(ch)

	fmt.Println("Waiting for worker...")
	msg := <-ch // blocks until worker sends data
	fmt.Println("Worker says:", msg)
}
```

✅ Output:

```
Waiting for worker...
Worker says: done
```

Here:

* `main` waits on `<-ch` until the goroutine sends "done".
* This **synchronizes** `main` and the worker.

---

## 🔹 Buffered vs Unbuffered Channels

### 1. **Unbuffered Channels** (default)

* No capacity → send blocks until a receiver is ready, and receive blocks until a sender is ready.
* Ensures **synchronization**.

```go
ch := make(chan int) // unbuffered
```

### 2. **Buffered Channels**

* Created with a capacity.
* Allows sending multiple values before blocking, up to the capacity.

```go
ch := make(chan int, 3) // capacity = 3
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
ch <- 3
// sending a 4th value will block until receiver consumes one
```

👉 Buffered channels provide **asynchronous communication**.

---

## 🔹 Closing a Channel

We can close a channel when no more values will be sent:

```go
close(ch)
```

After closing:

* Further sends → **panic**.
* Receives → still possible, but will yield **zero values** when channel is empty.

Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 10
	ch <- 20
	close(ch)

	for val := range ch {
		fmt.Println(val)
	}
}
```

✅ Output:

```
10
20
```

---

## 🔹 Directional Channels

We can restrict channels to **send-only** or **receive-only**.

```go
func sendData(ch chan<- int) { // send-only
	ch <- 100
}

func receiveData(ch <-chan int) { // receive-only
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```

This enforces **clear contracts** between functions.

---

## 🔹 Select Statement (Channel Multiplexing)

The `select` statement is like a `switch` for channels.
It waits on multiple channel operations and executes whichever is ready first.

```go
select {
case msg1 := <-ch1:
	fmt.Println("Received", msg1)
case msg2 := <-ch2:
	fmt.Println("Received", msg2)
default:
	fmt.Println("No messages")
}
```

👉 Useful for:

* Handling multiple channels.
* Adding **timeouts** with `time.After`.
* Preventing blocking with `default`.

---

## 🔹 Real Example: Worker Pool with Channels

Channels make it easy to build worker pools.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
	for job := range jobs {
		fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, job)
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		results <- job * 2
	}
}

func main() {
	jobs := make(chan int, 5)
	results := make(chan int, 5)

	// Start 3 workers
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		go worker(i, jobs, results)
	}

	// Send jobs
	for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs)

	// Collect results
	for r := 1; r <= 5; r++ {
		fmt.Println("Result:", <-results)
	}
}
```

✅ Output (order may vary):

```
Worker 1 processing job 1
Worker 2 processing job 2
Worker 3 processing job 3
Worker 1 processing job 4
Worker 2 processing job 5
Result: 2
Result: 4
Result: 6
Result: 8
Result: 10
```

This shows how channels + goroutines → powerful **concurrent systems**.

---

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

* Channels are **typed pipes** for goroutine communication.
* **Unbuffered channels** synchronize sender and receiver.
* **Buffered channels** allow limited async communication.
* Use `close()` to signal no more values.
* Directional channels (`chan<-`, `<-chan`) enforce contracts.
* `select` helps multiplex multiple channels.
* Channels + goroutines = safe, concurrent, and elegant design.

---

Now we’re going into the **guts of channels in Go**, the kind of stuff that matters if we want a *CS-level* understanding of why channels are so powerful and how they avoid race conditions. 🚀

---

# 🔬 Channels in Go: Under the Hood

Channels in Go aren’t magic — they’re implemented in the **Go runtime (part of the scheduler and memory model)**. Let’s break down their **internal structure, blocking mechanism, and scheduling behavior**.

---

## 1. Channel Data Structure (`hchan`)

Internally, every channel is represented by a structure called `hchan` (defined in Go’s runtime source, `runtime/chan.go`):

```go
type hchan struct {
    qcount   uint           // number of elements currently in queue
    dataqsiz uint           // size of the circular buffer
    buf      unsafe.Pointer // circular buffer (for buffered channels)
    elemsize uint16         // size of each element
    closed   uint32         // is channel closed?

    sendx    uint   // send index (next slot to write to)
    recvx    uint   // receive index (next slot to read from)

    recvq    waitq  // list of goroutines waiting to receive
    sendq    waitq  // list of goroutines waiting to send

    lock mutex       // protects all fields
}
```

### Key things to notice:

* **Circular Buffer** → if channel is buffered, data lives here.
* **Send/Recv Index** → used for round-robin access in buffer.
* **Wait Queues** → goroutines that are blocked are put here.
* **Lock** → ensures safe concurrent access (Go runtime manages locking, so we don’t).

---

## 2. Unbuffered Channels (Zero-Capacity)

Unbuffered channels are the simplest case:

* **Send (`ch <- x`)**:

  * If there’s already a goroutine waiting to receive, value is copied directly into its stack.
  * If not, sender blocks → it’s enqueued into `sendq` until a receiver arrives.

* **Receive (`<-ch`)**:

  * If there’s a waiting sender, value is copied directly.
  * If not, receiver blocks → it’s enqueued into `recvq` until a sender arrives.

👉 This is why unbuffered channels **synchronize goroutines**. No buffer exists; transfer happens only when both sides are ready.

---

## 3. Buffered Channels

Buffered channels add a **queue (circular buffer)**:

* **Send**:

  * If buffer not full → put value in buffer, increment `qcount`, update `sendx`.
  * If buffer full → block, enqueue sender in `sendq`.

* **Receive**:

  * If buffer not empty → take value from buffer, decrement `qcount`, update `recvx`.
  * If buffer empty → block, enqueue receiver in `recvq`.

👉 Buffered channels provide **asynchronous communication**, but when full/empty they still enforce synchronization.

---

## 4. Blocking and Goroutine Parking

When a goroutine **cannot proceed** (because channel is full or empty), Go’s runtime **parks** it:

* **Parking** = goroutine is put to sleep, removed from runnable state.
* **Unparking** = when the condition is satisfied (e.g., sender arrives), runtime wakes up the goroutine and puts it back on the scheduler queue.

This avoids **busy-waiting** (goroutines don’t spin-loop, they sleep efficiently).

---

## 5. Closing a Channel

When we `close(ch)`:

* `closed` flag in `hchan` is set.
* All goroutines in `recvq` are **woken up** and return the **zero value**.
* Any new send → **panic**.
* Receives on empty closed channel → return **zero value** immediately.

---

## 6. Select Statement Internals

`select` in Go is implemented like a **non-deterministic choice operator**:

1. The runtime looks at all channel cases.
2. If multiple channels are ready → **pick one pseudo-randomly** (to avoid starvation).
3. If none are ready → block the goroutine, enqueue it on all those channels’ `sendq/recvq`.
4. When one channel becomes available, runtime wakes up the goroutine, executes that case, and unregisters it from others.

👉 This is why `select` is **fair and efficient**.

---

## 7. Memory Model Guarantees

Channels follow Go’s **happens-before** relationship:

* A send on a channel **happens before** the corresponding receive completes.
* This ensures **visibility** of writes: when one goroutine sends a value, all memory writes before the send are guaranteed visible to the receiver after the receive.

This is similar to **release-acquire semantics** in CPU memory models.

---

## 8. Performance Notes

* Channels avoid **explicit locks** for user code — the runtime lock inside `hchan` is optimized with **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** instructions when possible.
* For heavy concurrency, channels can become a bottleneck (due to contention on `hchan.lock`). In such cases, Go devs sometimes use **lock-free data structures** or **sharded channels**.
* But for **safe communication**, channels are much cleaner than manual locking.

---

## 9. Analogy

Imagine a **mailbox system**:

* Unbuffered channel → one person waits at the mailbox until another arrives.
* Buffered channel → mailbox has slots; sender can drop letters until it’s full.
* `select` → person waiting at multiple mailboxes, ready to grab whichever letter arrives first.
* Closing → post office shuts down; no new letters allowed, but old ones can still be collected.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways (CS-level)

1. Channels are backed by a **lock-protected struct (`hchan`)** with a buffer and wait queues.
2. **Unbuffered channels** → synchronous handoff (sender ↔ receiver meet at the same time).
3. **Buffered channels** → async up to capacity, but still block when full/empty.
4. Blocked goroutines are **parked** efficiently, not spin-looping.
5. **Select** allows non-deterministic, fair channel multiplexing.
6. **Closing** signals termination and wakes receivers.
7. Channels provide **happens-before memory guarantees**, making them safer than manual synchronization.

---

Let’s go deep into **unbuffered vs buffered channels in Go**, both conceptually and under the hood (CS-level).

---

# 🔹 Channels Recap

A **channel** in Go is essentially a **typed conduit** that goroutines use to communicate. Think of it like a pipe with synchronization built-in. Under the hood, Go implements channels as a **struct (`hchan`)** in the runtime, which manages:

* A **queue (circular buffer)** of values
* A list of goroutines waiting to **send**
* A list of goroutines waiting to **receive**
* Locks for synchronization

---

# 🔹 Unbuffered Channels

An **unbuffered channel** is created like this:

```go
ch := make(chan int) // no buffer size specified
```

### ✅ Key Behavior:

* **Synchronous communication.**

  * A `send` (`ch <- v`) blocks until another goroutine executes a `receive` (`<-ch`).
  * A `receive` blocks until another goroutine sends.
* This creates a **rendezvous point** between goroutines: both must be ready simultaneously.

### 🔍 Under the hood:

* Since the buffer capacity = 0, the channel cannot hold values.
* When a goroutine executes `ch <- v`:

  1. The runtime checks if there’s a waiting receiver in the channel’s `recvq`.
  2. If yes → it directly transfers the value from sender to receiver (no buffer copy).
  3. If not → the sender goroutine is put to sleep and added to the `sendq`.
* Similarly, a receiver blocks until there’s a sender.

So **data is passed directly**, goroutine-to-goroutine, like a **handoff**.

### Example:

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        ch <- 42 // blocks until receiver is ready
    }()

    val := <-ch // blocks until sender is ready
    fmt.Println(val) // 42
}
```

This ensures synchronization — the print only happens after the send completes.

---

# 🔹 Buffered Channels

A **buffered channel** is created like this:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 3) // capacity = 3
```

### ✅ Key Behavior:

* **Asynchronous communication up to capacity.**

  * A `send` (`ch <- v`) only blocks if the buffer is full.
  * A `receive` (`<-ch`) only blocks if the buffer is empty.
* Acts like a **queue** between goroutines.

### 🔍 Under the hood:

* Channel has a circular buffer (`qcount`, `dataqsiz`, `buf`).
* On `ch <- v`:

  1. If a receiver is waiting → value bypasses buffer, sent directly.
  2. Else, if buffer is not full → value is enqueued in buffer.
  3. Else (buffer full) → sender goroutine is parked in `sendq`.
* On `<-ch`:

  1. If buffer has elements → dequeue and return.
  2. Else, if a sender is waiting → take value directly.
  3. Else → receiver goroutine is parked in `recvq`.

So buffered channels allow **decoupling**: senders and receivers don’t have to line up perfectly in time (up to buffer capacity).

### Example:

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 2)

    ch <- 1 // does not block
    ch <- 2 // does not block

    go func() {
        ch <- 3 // blocks until someone reads
    }()

    fmt.Println(<-ch) // frees up buffer, goroutine sends 3
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```

| Feature             | Unbuffered Channel                         | Buffered Channel                  |

---

# 🔹 Analogy

* **Unbuffered channel**: Like passing a note **hand-to-hand** — both people must meet at the same time.
* **Buffered channel**: Like a mailbox — sender can drop the note and leave, receiver can pick it up later (until the mailbox is full).

---

# 🔹 CS-Level Insight

* The Go runtime (`runtime/chan.go`) maintains:

  * `hchan` struct:

    ```go
    type hchan struct {
        qcount   uint           // number of elements in queue
        dataqsiz uint           // size of circular buffer
        buf      unsafe.Pointer // actual buffer
        sendx    uint           // next send index
        recvx    uint           // next receive index
        recvq    waitq          // list of waiting receivers
        sendq    waitq          // list of waiting senders
        lock     mutex
    }
    ```
* **Unbuffered**: `dataqsiz == 0`, always uses `sendq/recvq`.
* **Buffered**: Uses circular buffer for queuing, only parks goroutines when full/empty.

---

👉 So in short:

* **Unbuffered** channels couple goroutines tightly in time (synchronous handoff).
* **Buffered** channels decouple them (asynchronous, but limited by capacity).

---

Perfect 👌 — this is where Go really shines. Let’s break down how the **Go runtime** orchestrates **goroutines + channels** together, in detail, both conceptually and at the runtime (CS-level implementation).

---

# 🔹 The Go Runtime Model

Go doesn’t rely on the OS to schedule lightweight tasks. Instead, it implements its **own scheduler** inside the runtime. This allows goroutines and channels to work smoothly together.

---

## 1. **Goroutines in the Runtime**

* A **goroutine** is a lightweight thread of execution, managed by the Go runtime (not OS).
* Under the hood:

  * Each goroutine is represented by a `g` struct.
  * Each has its own **stack** (starts tiny, grows/shrinks dynamically).
  * Thousands (even millions) of goroutines can run inside one OS thread.

### Scheduler: **M:N model**

* **M** = OS threads
* **N** = Goroutines
* The runtime maps N goroutines onto M OS threads.
* **Key runtime structs:**

  * **M (Machine)** → OS thread
  * **P (Processor)** → Logical processor, responsible for scheduling goroutines on an M
  * **G (Goroutine)** → A goroutine itself
* Scheduling is **cooperative + preemptive**:

  * Goroutines yield at certain safe points (e.g., blocking operations, function calls).
  * Since Go 1.14, preemption also works at loop backedges.

So: goroutines are not OS-level threads — they’re scheduled by Go’s own runtime.

---

## 2. **Channels in the Runtime**

Channels are the **synchronization primitive** between goroutines.

Runtime implementation: `runtime/chan.go`.

Struct:

```go
type hchan struct {
    qcount   uint           // # of elements in queue
    dataqsiz uint           // buffer size
    buf      unsafe.Pointer // circular buffer
    sendx    uint           // next send index
    recvx    uint           // next receive index
    recvq    waitq          // waiting receivers
    sendq    waitq          // waiting senders
    lock     mutex
}
```

### Core idea:

* Channels are **queues with wait lists**:

  * If buffered → goroutines enqueue/dequeue values.
  * If unbuffered → goroutines handshake directly.
* Senders & receivers that cannot proceed are **parked** (suspended) into the `sendq` or `recvq`.

---

## 3. **How Goroutines & Channels Interact**

### Case A: Unbuffered channel

```go
ch := make(chan int)
go func() { ch <- 42 }()
val := <-ch
```

1. Sender (`ch <- 42`):

   * Lock channel.
   * Check `recvq` (waiting receivers).
   * If receiver waiting → value copied directly → receiver wakes up → sender continues.
   * If no receiver → sender is **parked** (blocked) and added to `sendq`.

2. Receiver (`<-ch`):

   * Lock channel.
   * Check `sendq` (waiting senders).
   * If sender waiting → value copied → sender wakes up → receiver continues.
   * If no sender → receiver is parked and added to `recvq`.

This ensures **synchronous handoff**.

---

### Case B: Buffered channel

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)
```

1. Sender (`ch <- v`):

   * Lock channel.
   * If `recvq` has waiting receivers → skip buffer, deliver directly.
   * Else if buffer has space → enqueue value → done.
   * Else (buffer full) → park sender in `sendq`.

2. Receiver (`<-ch`):

   * Lock channel.
   * If buffer has values → dequeue → done.
   * Else if `sendq` has waiting senders → take value directly.
   * Else → park receiver in `recvq`.

So buffered channels act as a **mailbox** (async up to capacity).

---

## 4. **Parking & Resuming Goroutines**

When goroutines can’t make progress (blocked send/recv), the runtime:

* **Parks** them: puts them in channel queues (`sendq` or `recvq`) and removes them from the scheduler’s run queue.
* Stores a `sudog` (suspended goroutine) object in the queue with metadata (which goroutine, element pointer, etc.).

When the condition is satisfied (buffer space, sender arrives, etc.):

* The runtime **wakes up** a waiting goroutine by moving it back into the scheduler’s run queue.
* The scheduler later assigns it to a P (processor) → M (thread) → resumes execution.

This is why Go channels feel seamless: the runtime transparently parks and wakes goroutines.

---

## 5. **Select & Channels**

`select` is also handled in runtime:

* The runtime checks multiple channels in random order to avoid starvation.
* If one is ready → proceeds immediately.
* If none are ready → goroutine is parked, attached to all involved channels’ queues, and woken up when one becomes available.

---

## 6. **Performance & Efficiency**

* Channel operations are protected by **mutex + atomic ops** → very efficient.
* Goroutines are cheap (KB stack, small structs).
* Parking/waking is implemented in pure runtime → no heavy syscalls unless all goroutines block (then Go hands thread back to OS).

---

# 🔹 Visual Summary

### Unbuffered

```
G1: ch <- 42   <----->   G2: val := <-ch
(synchronous handoff, both must rendezvous)
```

### Buffered

```
G1: ch <- 42 ---> [ buffer ] ---> G2: val := <-ch
(asynchronous until buffer full/empty)
```

### Runtime scheduling

```
[M:OS Thread] <----> [P:Logical Processor] <----> [G:Goroutine Queue]
```

---

# 🔹 Big Picture

* **Goroutines** = cheap lightweight threads managed by Go runtime.
* **Scheduler** = M:N model with P (processor) abstraction.
* **Channels** = safe queues with wait lists.
* **Interaction** = senders/receivers park & wake, enabling CSP-style concurrency.
* **Runtime magic** = efficient, cooperative scheduling + lightweight context switching.

---

👉 So: goroutines are like "actors," channels are "mailboxes," and the Go runtime is the "stage manager" that schedules actors and delivers their messages efficiently.

---

Let’s build a **step-by-step execution timeline** for how the Go runtime handles **goroutines + channels**.

Two cases: **unbuffered** and **buffered** channels.

---

# 🔹 Case 1: Unbuffered Channel

Code:

```go
ch := make(chan int)

go func() {
    ch <- 42
    fmt.Println("Sent 42")
}()

val := <-ch
fmt.Println("Received", val)
```

---

### Execution Timeline (runtime flow)

1. **Main goroutine (G_main)** creates channel `ch` (capacity = 0).

   * Runtime allocates an `hchan` struct with empty `sendq` and `recvq`.

2. **Spawn goroutine (G1)** → scheduled by runtime onto an M (OS thread) via some P.

3. **G1 executes `ch <- 42`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Since `recvq` is empty, no receiver is waiting.
   * Create a `sudog` for G1 (stores goroutine pointer + value).
   * Add `sudog` to `sendq`.
   * **G1 is parked (blocked)** → removed from run queue.

4. **Main goroutine executes `<-ch`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Sees `sendq` has a waiting sender (G1).
   * Runtime copies `42` from G1’s stack to G_main’s stack.
   * Removes G1 from `sendq`.
   * Marks G1 as runnable → puts it back in the scheduler’s run queue.
   * G_main continues with value `42`.

5. **Scheduler resumes G1** → prints `"Sent 42"`.
   **Main goroutine prints `"Received 42"`.

---

🔸 **Key point**: In unbuffered channels, send/recv must rendezvous. One goroutine blocks until the other arrives.

---

# 🔹 Case 2: Buffered Channel

Code:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)

go func() {
    ch <- 1
    ch <- 2
    ch <- 3
    fmt.Println("Sent all")
}()

time.Sleep(time.Millisecond) // give sender time
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)
```

---

### Execution Timeline (runtime flow)

1. **Main goroutine (G_main)** creates channel `ch` (capacity = 2).

   * Runtime allocates buffer (circular queue), size = 2.

2. **Spawn goroutine (G1)**.

3. **G1 executes `ch <- 1`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Buffer not full (0/2).
   * Enqueue `1` at `buf[0]`.
   * Increment `qcount` = 1.
   * Return immediately (non-blocking).

4. **G1 executes `ch <- 2`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Buffer not full (1/2).
   * Enqueue `2` at `buf[1]`.
   * `qcount` = 2.
   * Return immediately.

5. **G1 executes `ch <- 3`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Buffer is full (2/2).
   * No receivers waiting (`recvq` empty).
   * Create `sudog` for G1.
   * Put it in `sendq`.
   * Park G1 (blocked).

6. **Main goroutine executes `<-ch`:**

   * Lock channel.
   * Buffer has elements (`qcount` = 2).
   * Dequeue `1`.
   * `qcount` = 1.
   * Since there’s a blocked sender in `sendq` (G1 with value `3`), runtime:

     * Wakes G1.
     * Copies `3` into buffer (at freed slot).
     * G1 resumes later.

7. **Main goroutine executes `<-ch` again:**

   * Dequeue `2`.
   * `qcount` = 1 (still has `3`).

8. **Main goroutine executes `<-ch` final time:**

   * Dequeue `3`.
   * `qcount` = 0 (buffer empty).

9. **Scheduler resumes G1** → `"Sent all"` printed.

---

🔸 **Key point**: Buffered channels decouple sender/receiver timing. G1 only blocked when the buffer was full.

---

# 🔹 Visual Snapshot

### Unbuffered

```
G1: send(42) ---- waits ----> G_main: recv() 
             <--- wakes ----
```

### Buffered (capacity = 2)

```
Buffer: [ 1 ][ 2 ]    <- send 1, send 2
Buffer: full          <- send 3 blocks
Recv 1 → slot frees   <- wakes sender, puts 3 in
Recv 2, Recv 3        <- empties buffer
```

---

👉 In both cases, the **Go runtime orchestrates this**:

* `sendq` & `recvq` hold waiting goroutines (`sudog` objects).
* Blocked goroutines are **parked** (suspended).
* When conditions change (buffer frees, peer arrives), goroutines are **woken** and put back into the scheduler’s run queue.

---

# Buffered channels in Go — deep dive 🔎

A **buffered channel** is a channel with capacity > 0:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 3) // capacity 3
```

It provides a small queue (a circular buffer) between senders and receivers. A send (`ch <- v`) only blocks when the buffer is **full**; a receive (`<-ch`) only blocks when the buffer is **empty** — *unless* there are waiting peers, in which case the runtime can do a direct handoff.

Use it when we want to **decouple producer and consumer timing** (allow short bursts) but still bound memory and concurrency.

---

# Creation & introspection

* Create: `ch := make(chan T, capacity)` where `capacity >= 1`.
* Zero value is `nil`: `var ch chan int` → nil channel (send/recv block forever).
* Inspect: `len(ch)` gives number of queued elements, `cap(ch)` gives capacity.

---

# High-level send/receive rules (precise)

**When sending (`ch <- v`)**:

1. If there is a *waiting receiver* (parked on `recvq`) → **direct transfer**: runtime copies `v` to receiver and wakes it (no buffer enqueue).
2. Else if the buffer has free slots (`len < cap`) → **enqueue** the value into the circular buffer and return immediately.
3. Else (buffer full and no receiver) → **park the sender** (sudog) on the channel's `sendq` and block.

**When receiving (`<-ch`)**:

1. If buffer has queued items (`len > 0`) → **dequeue** an item and return it.
2. Else if there is a *waiting sender* (in `sendq`) → **direct transfer**: take the sender’s value and wake the sender.
3. Else (buffer empty and no sender) → **park the receiver** on `recvq` and block.

> Important: the runtime prefers delivering directly to a waiting peer if one exists — it avoids unnecessary buffer operations and wake-ups.

---

# Under-the-hood (simplified runtime view)

Channels are implemented by the runtime in a structure conceptually like:

```go
// simplified conceptual fields
type hchan struct {
    qcount   uint         // number of elements currently in buffer
    dataqsiz uint         // capacity (buffer size)
    buf      unsafe.Pointer // pointer to circular buffer memory
    sendx    uint         // next index to send (enqueue)
    recvx    uint         // next index to receive (dequeue)
    sendq    waitq        // queue of waiting senders (sudog)
    recvq    waitq        // queue of waiting receivers (sudog)
    lock     mutex        // protects the channel's state
}
```

* The buffer is a circular array indexed by `sendx`/`recvx` modulo `dataqsiz`.
* `sendq` and `recvq` are queues of parked goroutines (sudog objects) waiting for a send/receive.
* Operations lock the channel, check queues and buffer, then either enqueue/dequeue or park/unpark goroutines.
* Parked goroutines are moved back to the scheduler run queue when woken.

---

# Example — behavior & output

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2) // capacity 2

	go func() {
		ch <- 1 // does NOT block
		fmt.Println("sent 1")
		ch <- 2 // does NOT block
		fmt.Println("sent 2")
		ch <- 3 // blocks until receiver consumes one
		fmt.Println("sent 3")
	}()

	time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // let sender run

	fmt.Println("recv:", <-ch) // receives 1; this will unblock sender for 3
	fmt.Println("recv:", <-ch) // receives 2
	fmt.Println("recv:", <-ch) // receives 3
}
```

Expected printed sequence (order may vary slightly with scheduling, but logically):

```
sent 1
sent 2
recv: 1
sent 3       // unblocks here after first recv frees slot
recv: 2
recv: 3
```

---

# Closing a buffered channel

* `close(ch)`:

  * Makes the channel no longer accept sends. Any sends to a closed channel Panic.
  * Receivers can still drain buffered items.
  * Once buffer is empty, subsequent receives return the zero value and `ok == false`.
* Example:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 10
ch <- 20
close(ch)

v, ok := <-ch // v==10, ok==true
v, ok = <-ch  // v==20, ok==true
v, ok = <-ch  // v==0, ok==false (channel drained and closed)
```

* Closing is normally done by the **sender/owner** side. Closing from multiple places or closing when other senders still send is dangerous.

---

# `select` + buffered channels (non-blocking tries)

We often use a `select` with `default` to attempt a non-blocking send/recv:

```go
select {
case ch <- v:
    // succeeded
default:
    // buffer full — do alternate action
}
```

This is how we implement try-send / try-receive semantics.

---

# Typical patterns & idioms

1. **Bounded buffer / producer-consumer**

   * Buffer provides smoothing for bursts.
2. **Worker pool (task queue)**

   * `tasks := make(chan Task, queueSize)` — spawn worker goroutines that `for t := range tasks { ... }`.
3. **Semaphore / concurrency limiter**

   ```go
   sem := make(chan struct{}, N) // allow N concurrent active tasks
   sem <- struct{}{}             // acquire (blocks when N reached)
   <-sem                        // release
   ```
4. **Pipelines**

   * Stage outputs into buffered channels to decouple stages.

---

# Synchronization & memory visibility

* A successful **send** on a channel *synchronizes with* the corresponding **receive** that receives the value. That means the receive sees all memory writes that happened before the send (happens-before guarantee).
* Using channels for signalling is safe: if we send after setting fields, the receiver will see those fields set.

---

# Performance considerations

* Buffered channels improve throughput where producers and consumers are not tightly synchronized.
* Too large buffers:

  * Consume more memory.
  * Increase latency for consumers (items may sit in buffer).
  * Mask backpressure (producers can outrun consumers).
* Too small buffers:

  * Lead to frequent blocking and context switching.
* Tuning:

  * Choose `cap` to match burst size / acceptable queueing.
  * For heavy throughput, benchmark channels vs other concurrency primitives (e.g., pools, atomics) — channels are convenient and fast but not free.

---

# Common pitfalls & gotchas

* **Deadlock**: If producers fill the buffer and nobody consumes, they block. If blocked sends prevent the program from progressing, deadlock occurs.
* **Send on closed channel**: panic — avoid by ensuring only the owner closes the channel.
* **Nil channel**: `var ch chan T` without make is `nil` — send/recv block forever.
* **Large struct values**: sending large values copies them into the buffer; prefer pointers or smaller structs if copying is expensive.
* **Mixing close and multiple senders**: close only from a single owner to avoid races/panics.

---

# FIFO & fairness

* The runtime enqueues waiting senders/receivers (sudogs) and generally wakes them in FIFO order — so waiting goroutines are served in roughly the order they arrived. For `select` across multiple channels, selection is randomized among ready cases to avoid starvation.

---

# Quick cheatsheet

* `make(chan T, n)` → buffered channel with capacity `n`.
* `len(ch)` → items queued now.
* `cap(ch)` → total capacity.
* `close(ch)` → no more sends; readers drain buffer then get `ok==false`.
* `select { case ch<-v: default: }` → non-blocking send attempt.

---

# When to use buffered channels

* When producers produce in bursts and consumers are slower but able to catch up.
* When you want some decoupling but still bounded memory/queueing.
* When you need a simple concurrency limiter (semaphore style).

---

Channel Synchronization is one of the most important and elegant parts of Go’s concurrency model.

---

# 🔹 What is Channel Synchronization?

* In Go, **channels are not just for communication** (passing values between goroutines).
* They are also a **synchronization primitive**: they coordinate execution order between goroutines.

Think of it like:
👉 **Send blocks until the receiver is ready** (unbuffered)
👉 **Receive blocks until the sender provides data**
👉 This mutual blocking acts as a synchronization point.

---

# 🔹 Case 1: Synchronization with **Unbuffered Channels**

Unbuffered channels enforce **strict rendezvous synchronization**:

* When goroutine A sends (`ch <- x`), it is **blocked** until goroutine B executes a receive (`<- ch`).
* Both goroutines meet at the channel, exchange data, and continue.

### Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(done chan bool) {
	fmt.Println("Worker: started")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Worker: finished")

	// notify main goroutine
	done <- true
}

func main() {
	done := make(chan bool)

	go worker(done)

	// wait for worker to finish
	<-done
	fmt.Println("Main: all done")
}
```

🔎 Here:

* `done <- true` **synchronizes** the worker with the main goroutine.
* Main will **block** on `<-done` until the worker signals.
* No explicit `mutex` or condition variable is needed — the channel ensures correct ordering.

---

# 🔹 Case 2: Synchronization with **Buffered Channels**

Buffered channels allow **decoupling** between sender and receiver, but can still be used for synchronization.

Rules:

* Sending blocks **only if buffer is full**.
* Receiving blocks **only if buffer is empty**.

### Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(tasks chan int, done chan bool) {
	for {
		task, more := <-tasks
		if !more {
			fmt.Println("Worker: all tasks done")
			done <- true
			return
		}
		fmt.Println("Worker: processing task", task)
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

func main() {
	tasks := make(chan int, 3)
	done := make(chan bool)

	go worker(tasks, done)

	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println("Main: sending task", i)
		tasks <- i
	}
	close(tasks) // signals no more tasks

	<-done // wait for worker
	fmt.Println("Main: worker finished")
}
```

🔎 Here:

* Buffer allows **temporary queuing** of tasks.
* Synchronization happens when `tasks` is full (main blocks) or empty (worker blocks).
* Closing the channel signals the worker to stop.

---

# 🔹 How the Go Runtime Synchronizes with Channels

Now let’s peek **under the hood**.

### 1. Each channel (`hchan`) has:

* A **buffer** (circular queue, if buffered).
* Two wait queues:

  * `sendq` → goroutines waiting to send.
  * `recvq` → goroutines waiting to receive.

### 2. Unbuffered channel (capacity = 0):

* A send operation checks `recvq`:

  * If a goroutine is waiting to receive → direct handoff (value copied, receiver resumed).
  * If not → sender parks itself in `sendq` (blocked).
* A receive operation checks `sendq`:

  * If a goroutine is waiting to send → direct handoff.
  * If not → receiver parks itself in `recvq`.

This ensures **synchronous rendezvous**.

---

### 3. Buffered channel (capacity > 0):

* Send:

  * If buffer is **not full** → enqueue value, return immediately.
  * If buffer is **full** → block in `sendq`.
* Receive:

  * If buffer is **not empty** → dequeue value, return immediately.
  * If buffer is **empty** → block in `recvq`.

---

### 4. Synchronization = parking and unparking goroutines

* When a goroutine blocks, the runtime:

  * Saves its state (stack, registers).
  * Moves it off the run queue.
  * Adds it to the channel’s wait queue.
* When the opposite operation happens, the runtime:

  * Wakes a goroutine from the wait queue.
  * Puts it back on the scheduler run queue.
* This is how Go **synchronizes goroutines without explicit locks**.

---

# 🔹 Real-world Patterns of Channel Synchronization

1. **Signaling** (done channels, as in worker example).
2. **Worker pools** (tasks + done channels).
3. **Bounded queues** (buffered channels to control throughput).
4. **Fan-in / Fan-out** (multiple producers and consumers).
5. **Rate limiting** (token buckets using buffered channels).

---

✅ **Summary**

* Channels synchronize goroutines naturally: **send blocks until receive, receive blocks until send** (with buffering rules).
* Runtime uses **wait queues (sendq, recvq)** and **goroutine parking/unparking** for this.
* This synchronization mechanism replaces the need for explicit mutexes in many cases.

---

Great 🚀 — let’s deep-dive into **channel synchronization in Go**, because this is one of the core reasons channels exist: **coordinating goroutines safely without explicit locks**.

We’ll go step by step, from simple usage all the way to **CS-level synchronization semantics**.

---

# 🔹 What is Synchronization?

**Synchronization** means making sure multiple concurrent goroutines operate in a **coordinated, predictable way**, without stepping on each other’s work or causing race conditions.

In Go, channels synchronize goroutines by enforcing rules on when data can be sent and received.

---

# 🔹 1. How Channels Synchronize

Channels synchronize via **blocking semantics**:

* **Send (`ch <- value`)**:

  * Blocks until a receiver is ready (on unbuffered channel).
  * On buffered channel, blocks if buffer is full.

* **Receive (`<-ch`)**:

  * Blocks until a sender sends.
  * On buffered channel, blocks if buffer is empty.

👉 This blocking ensures **coordination**: the sending goroutine knows the receiver has received (or will eventually receive) the value.

---

# 🔹 2. Synchronization with Unbuffered Channels

Unbuffered channels are the **purest form of synchronization**.
They act like a **handshake**: both goroutines must be ready at the same time.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(done chan bool) {
	fmt.Println("Working...")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Done work")

	// notify main
	done <- true
}

func main() {
	done := make(chan bool)

	go worker(done)

	// main waits for signal
	<-done
	fmt.Println("Main exits")
}
```

✅ Explanation:

* `worker` sends `true` into `done`.
* `main` is blocked on `<-done` until the worker finishes.
* This ensures **main only exits after worker is done**.

This is pure **synchronization without shared memory**.

---

# 🔹 3. Synchronization with Buffered Channels

Buffered channels add a **queue** (limited capacity), which changes synchronization rules:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 1 // does not block
ch <- 2 // still fine
// ch <- 3 would block until someone reads
```

* Buffered channels let sender and receiver **work asynchronously** (up to the buffer capacity).
* Still provide synchronization when buffer is full (sender waits) or empty (receiver waits).

Use case: **producer-consumer pattern**.

---

# 🔹 4. Synchronization via Closing a Channel

Closing channels is another synchronization signal:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
		close(ch) // signal: no more data
	}()

	// range until channel closes
	for v := range ch {
		fmt.Println("Received:", v)
	}
	fmt.Println("All done")
}
```

✅ Here:

* `close(ch)` synchronizes **end of data stream**.
* Receivers know exactly when producer is finished.

---

# 🔹 5. Synchronization with `select`

`select` synchronizes across **multiple channels**.

Example: timeout synchronization

```go
select {
case msg := <-ch:
	fmt.Println("Got:", msg)
case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
	fmt.Println("Timeout")
}
```

👉 This synchronizes **channel communication with time constraints**.

---

# 🔹 6. Under the Hood (CS-Level Synchronization)

At runtime:

* Every channel (`hchan`) has a **mutex lock** and **wait queues** (`sendq`, `recvq`).
* When a goroutine sends and no receiver is ready, it’s **parked** (blocked) in `sendq`.
* When a goroutine receives and no sender is ready, it’s **parked** in `recvq`.
* When a match happens (send & receive ready), the Go runtime:

  1. Locks the channel.
  2. Transfers the value directly (or via buffer).
  3. **Unparks** the waiting goroutine (wakes it up).
  4. Releases the lock.

This mechanism guarantees:

* **No busy-waiting** (goroutines don’t spin, they sleep).
* **FIFO fairness** (waiting goroutines handled in queue order).
* **Memory safety**: A send happens-before a corresponding receive completes.

👉 This “happens-before” guarantee ensures **synchronization of memory writes** (data visible to sender before send is visible to receiver after receive).

---

# 🔹 7. Patterns of Synchronization with Channels

1. **Signal Notification**

   * Use a channel just to notify completion (`done chan struct{}`).

2. **Worker Pools**

   * Workers consume jobs from a channel, producer feeds jobs in.

3. **Fan-in / Fan-out**

   * Multiple goroutines send to one channel (fan-in).
   * One producer sends to multiple consumers (fan-out).

4. **Pipeline**

   * Stages of computation connected by channels, synchronized at each stage.

# 🔹 8. Comparison with Mutex Synchronization

* **Mutex**: Protects shared memory by locking. Synchronization is about *exclusive access*.
* **Channel**: Passes ownership of data. Synchronization is about *handover of values/events*.

👉 Go’s philosophy: “**Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating**.”

This makes channel-based synchronization **less error-prone** than locks (no risk of forgetting `Unlock()` or deadlock chains).

# 🔹 Key Takeaways

1. Channels synchronize goroutines by **blocking semantics** (send/receive waits until possible).
2. **Unbuffered channels** → strongest synchronization, like a handshake.
3. **Buffered channels** → allow async work but still block when full/empty.
4. **Closing channels** synchronizes termination/end of data.
5. **Select** multiplexes synchronization across many events.
6. Under the hood → `hchan`, wait queues, goroutine parking, **happens-before memory model guarantees**.
7. Channels are safer than mutexes because they transfer ownership instead of sharing memory.
