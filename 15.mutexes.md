}
```

### üß† Step-by-step Breakdown

---

#### **Imports**

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)
```

We‚Äôre importing:

* `fmt` ‚Üí for printing output to the console.
* `sync` ‚Üí which gives us synchronization primitives like `Mutex` and `WaitGroup` for managing concurrency safely.

---

#### **Comment Block**

```go
/*
mutexes - mitual exclution, sync. primitive which prevents multiple goroutines from simultaneously accessing shared resources or exeuting critical sections of the code. Ensures that only 1 goroutine can hold the 'mutex' at a time, thus avaoiding race-conditions and data-corruption. üíª
*/
```

That‚Äôs a perfect conceptual description already:
üëâ A **mutex (mutual exclusion lock)** ensures that only **one goroutine** can access a critical section (shared resource) at any given time.
This prevents **race conditions** ‚Äî situations where multiple goroutines try to read and write to the same variable concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.

---

#### **Struct Definition**

```go
type Counter struct{
	mu sync.Mutex
	val int
}
```

We define a struct named `Counter` that contains:

* `mu`: a **mutex** to control concurrent access.
* `val`: an integer counter we want to update safely from multiple goroutines.

Think of the mutex as a **lock on a door** ‚Äî only one goroutine can enter (modify `val`) at a time.

---

#### **increment() method**

```go
func (c *Counter)increment(){
	c.mu.Lock()
	c.val++
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
}
```

This method increments the counter.

Let‚Äôs go line-by-line inside it:

1. **`c.mu.Lock()`**

   * This locks the mutex.
   * If another goroutine already holds the lock, this goroutine will **wait (block)** until the mutex is unlocked.
   * Once it obtains the lock, it enters the critical section (safe area to modify `val`).

2. **`c.val++`**

   * This is the critical section.
   * `val++` is *not* an atomic operation ‚Äî it actually does three things internally:

     ```
     temp = c.val
     temp = temp + 1
     c.val = temp
     ```

     So if multiple goroutines did this at the same time without a mutex, they‚Äôd overwrite each other‚Äôs updates ‚Äî that‚Äôs the classic race condition.

3. **`defer c.mu.Unlock()`**

   * The `defer` schedules the unlock to run *after the function finishes*.
   * In Go, deferred calls run in **LIFO order** just before the function returns.
   * So when `increment()` ends, the mutex automatically unlocks ‚Äî allowing another goroutine to acquire it and safely increment again.

üü° **Note:** Normally, we place `defer c.mu.Unlock()` *right after* `Lock()` to guarantee unlock even if something panics before the increment.
But since `c.val++` here can‚Äôt panic, it still works ‚Äî just not the most idiomatic placement.

---

#### **getVal() method**

```go
func (c *Counter) getVal()int{
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	return c.val
}
```

This method safely reads the counter‚Äôs value.

* It locks before reading `c.val` (to ensure we‚Äôre not reading while another goroutine is writing).
* It defers unlock immediately (idiomatic).
* It returns the counter value once the lock is released.

So even reading is synchronized ‚Äî preventing data races between read/write.

---

#### **main() function**

```go
func main() {
	// waitgroups for multiple goroutines
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	counter:= &Counter{}
	numOfGoroutines := 10
```

Here:

* `wg` ‚Üí a `WaitGroup` to track and wait for multiple goroutines to finish.
* `counter` ‚Üí a pointer to a `Counter` instance (we use a pointer so we don‚Äôt accidentally copy the mutex).
* `numOfGoroutines := 10` ‚Üí we‚Äôll spawn 10 goroutines to increment the counter concurrently.

---

#### **Launching Goroutines**

```go
	for range numOfGoroutines{
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for range 100{
				counter.increment()
			}
		}()
	}
```

Even though `for range numOfGoroutines` and `for range 100` wouldn‚Äôt compile in Go (you‚Äôd normally write `for i := 0; i < numOfGoroutines; i++`), let‚Äôs **conceptually** understand what this loop is *intended* to do:

* The loop runs **10 times**, creating 10 goroutines.
* Each goroutine:

  * Calls `defer wg.Done()` ‚Üí meaning when that goroutine finishes, it signals the WaitGroup that one job is done.
  * Runs another loop **100 times**, calling `counter.increment()` each time.

So effectively:

```
10 goroutines √ó 100 increments each = 1000 total increments
```

Each call to `increment()` locks the mutex, increments safely, and unlocks, one at a time.

This creates **serialized access** to the shared counter.

---

#### **Wait for Completion**

```go
	wg.Wait()
```

The main goroutine blocks here until all 10 goroutines have called `wg.Done()` (i.e., finished their 100 increments each).

Once all have finished ‚Üí `wg.Wait()` unblocks.

---

#### **Final Print**

```go
	fmt.Printf("‚úÖ Final counter val: %d\n",counter.getVal()) // unreliable output without 'mutex'
```

Finally, we print the counter value.

If mutexes were missing:

* The increments would overlap (race conditions).
* The result would be random and **less than 1000** most of the time.

But since we used the mutex correctly, the result is always:

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 1000
```

---

### üîç Why it works perfectly

1. Only one goroutine modifies `c.val` at any given moment.
2. The mutex ensures mutual exclusion.
3. The WaitGroup ensures synchronization ‚Äî we don‚Äôt print before work finishes.
4. The final print happens after all increments are complete.

Hence, the output is deterministic and correct.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood

Let‚Äôs visualize what‚Äôs happening during execution:

```
Goroutine-1 locks -> increments -> unlocks
Goroutine-2 locks -> increments -> unlocks
Goroutine-3 locks -> increments -> unlocks
...
```

Each goroutine tries to acquire the lock. If it‚Äôs taken, it waits.
Once the lock is free, it grabs it, increments, defers the unlock, and releases it ‚Äî giving the next goroutine a chance.

This sequence happens very fast, so effectively the counter increments appear atomic.

---

---

### üß† TL;DR

Your code demonstrates **safe concurrent access** to a shared variable using:

* `sync.Mutex` ‚Üí to ensure **mutual exclusion**.
* `sync.WaitGroup` ‚Üí to ensure **completion synchronization**.

Each goroutine safely increments the counter 100 times, producing a predictable final output:

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 1000
```
---

Alright let‚Äôs go through **the exact code** line by line, as it is, **without changing anything**, and deeply understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood.

---

### üß± Code Overview

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)
```

We‚Äôre importing:

* **fmt** ‚Üí for printing output
* **sync** ‚Üí for synchronization primitives like `Mutex` and `WaitGroup`

---

### üîí Step 1: The `Counter` struct

```go
type Counter struct {
	mu  sync.Mutex
	val int
}
```

* `mu` ‚Üí a **mutex** that ensures mutual exclusion.
* `val` ‚Üí our **shared resource** (the counter value) that multiple goroutines will modify.

The mutex ensures that **only one goroutine at a time** can access/modify `val`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: `increment` method

```go
func (c *Counter) increment() {
	c.mu.Lock()
	c.val++
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
}
```

Let‚Äôs unpack this carefully:

1. `c.mu.Lock()` ‚Üí acquires the **lock**.

   * If another goroutine already holds the lock, this goroutine will **block** (pause) until the lock is released.

2. `c.val++` ‚Üí increments the shared counter.

3. `defer c.mu.Unlock()` ‚Üí schedules unlocking once the function returns.

> üí° Even though the `defer` line appears **after** `c.val++`, it‚Äôs still **registered immediately** when that line executes.
> So, `Unlock()` will happen when `increment()` finishes.

In effect, for each goroutine:

* It **locks**, increments safely, and **then unlocks** before another goroutine can enter this critical section.

---

### üîç Step 3: `getVal` method

```go
func (c *Counter) getVal() int {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	return c.val
}
```

This function also locks the mutex before reading the shared value.
That ensures we don‚Äôt read it while another goroutine might be writing to it ‚Äî preventing **race conditions** during read operations.

---

### üë∑ Step 4: Inside `main()`

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
counter := &Counter{}
numOfGoroutines := 10
```

* We create a **WaitGroup** to wait for all goroutines to finish.
* We create a shared **counter** instance (pointer so that all goroutines access the same one).
* We‚Äôll run **10 goroutines** to increment it concurrently.

---

### üöÄ Step 5: Spawning goroutines

```go
for range numOfGoroutines {
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for range 100 {
			counter.increment()
		}
	}()
}
```

Let‚Äôs decode this loop:

1. `for range numOfGoroutines`

   * Runs 10 times because `numOfGoroutines` is `10`.

2. Each iteration:

   * Adds 1 to the WaitGroup (`wg.Add(1)`).
   * Launches a **new goroutine** ‚Äî an independent lightweight thread of execution.

3. Inside each goroutine:

   * `defer wg.Done()` ensures that when it finishes, it signals the main goroutine that it‚Äôs done.
   * The inner `for range 100` loop runs 100 times, incrementing the counter 100 times **safely**.

So, in total:

```
10 goroutines √ó 100 increments each = 1000 increments total
```

---

### üïí Step 6: Waiting for all goroutines

```go
wg.Wait()
```

* The main goroutine waits here until **all 10 goroutines** have called `wg.Done()`.
* This ensures all increments complete before we move to print the final value.

---

### üßÆ Step 7: Printing the final result

```go
fmt.Printf("‚úÖ Final counter val: %d\n", counter.getVal())
```

At this point:

* All goroutines are finished.
* The mutex guarantees no race conditions.
* The final value of the counter = **1000** (10 √ó 100).

---

### ‚úÖ Output

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 1000
```

---

### üß† Why mutex is essential here

Without the mutex, multiple goroutines could execute `c.val++` simultaneously.
This looks innocent, but it‚Äôs not atomic ‚Äî under the hood, it‚Äôs equivalent to:

```go
temp := c.val   // read
temp = temp + 1 // increment
c.val = temp    // write
```

If two goroutines do this at once, one‚Äôs write could **overwrite** another‚Äôs result, leading to a smaller final count (e.g., 967, 984, etc.).

The mutex ensures these three steps happen **as one atomic block** ‚Äî no interruptions.

---

### üß© Summary Table

| Step                | Operation | Protected by Mutex?          | Notes |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| Increment (`val++`) | ‚úÖ         | Prevents race condition      |       |
| Read (`getVal()`)   | ‚úÖ         | Ensures consistent read      |       |
| Concurrent access   | ‚úÖ         | Only one goroutine at a time |       |
| Final output        | `1000`    | Always correct               |       |

---

### üß≠ Real-world analogy

Think of the mutex as a **key to a single restroom** üöª:

* Only one person (goroutine) can enter at a time.
* Everyone else must wait until the key is returned (Unlock).
* Once done, the next in line can safely go in.

---

Perfect,  üî• let‚Äôs now see **exactly what goes wrong** when we remove the mutex and why the final value becomes unreliable.
We‚Äôll use our same code, but comment out the mutex parts so we can clearly see the difference in behavior.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Version WITHOUT Mutex

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

type Counter struct {
	val int
}

func (c *Counter) increment() {
	// ‚ùå No mutex protection
	c.val++
}

func (c *Counter) getVal() int {
	return c.val
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	counter := &Counter{}
	numOfGoroutines := 10

	for range numOfGoroutines {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for range 100 {
				counter.increment()
			}
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): %d\n", counter.getVal())
}
```

---

## üß† Expected output (if perfectly serialized)

If everything ran in perfect sequence, we‚Äôd expect:

```
10 goroutines √ó 100 increments = 1000
```

So, the final value **should** be `1000`.

---

## üòà Actual output (race condition at play)

Run this several times, and you‚Äôll likely see outputs like:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): 973
‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): 991
‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): 985
‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): 1000
‚ö†Ô∏è Final counter val (no mutex): 968
```

The number changes **randomly** on each run.
That randomness is the result of **race conditions**.

---

## üîç Why race conditions occur

Let‚Äôs zoom into the line:

```go
c.val++
```

This looks atomic but it‚Äôs **actually three CPU-level operations**:

1. **Read** the current value of `c.val` from memory into a register.
2. **Add 1** to it.
3. **Write** the new value back to memory.

Now imagine two goroutines (G1, G2) running in parallel on different CPU cores:

| Step | G1                | G2                | Result             |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | Reads `c.val = 5` | ‚Äî                 | ‚Äî                  |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | ‚Äî                 | Reads `c.val = 5` | ‚Äî                  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | Increments ‚Üí `6`  | Increments ‚Üí `6`  | ‚ùå One update lost! |

Each thinks it incremented `5 ‚Üí 6`, but both wrote `6`.
So, one increment **overwrites** the other ‚Äî a classic race condition.

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detecting it with Go‚Äôs race detector

Go actually comes with a built-in **race detector**.
Try running your code with:

```
go run -race .
```

Output example:

```
==================
WARNING: DATA RACE
Read at 0x00c0000a6010 by goroutine 8:
  main.(*Counter).increment()
      /path/to/main.go:13 +0x3c
...
Found 1 data race(s)
exit status 66
```

The race detector identifies unsynchronized reads/writes to shared memory and warns us.

---

## üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ Version WITH Mutex (Safe One)

Now compare it with your earlier code:

```go
func (c *Counter) increment() {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	c.val++
}
```

Now:

* Only **one goroutine** can perform `c.val++` at a time.
* The others **wait** at `Lock()` until it‚Äôs released.
* So, all 1000 increments are guaranteed to complete without data loss.

‚úÖ Output will **always** be:

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 1000
```

---

## üß© Real-World Analogy

Imagine 10 people (goroutines) trying to **update a whiteboard** at the same time.

* Without rules (mutex): they bump into each other, overwrite numbers, and cause chaos.
* With a rule (mutex): only one person writes at a time while others wait ‚Äî result stays correct.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **ANOTHER EXAMPLE** üçÅ

This example beautifully shows how **mutexes** protect shared variables even when that variable itself doesn‚Äôt belong to a struct. Let‚Äôs break it down piece by piece and answer our key questions:

> ‚Äúüí° How do mutexes understand which values to protect?‚Äù

---

```go 
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

//üí°mutexes - how do they understand which values to protect?

func main() {

	var counter int
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	var mu sync.Mutex

	numOfGoroutines:=5
	wg.Add(numOfGoroutines)

	increment:= func ()  {
		// can be used inside loops too
		defer wg.Done()
		for range 1000{
			mu.Lock()
			counter++
			mu.Unlock()
		}
	}

	for range numOfGoroutines{
		go increment()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("‚úÖ Final counter val: %d\n",counter)
	
	// O.P- 
	// $ go run .
	// ‚úÖ Final counter val: 5000
	
}
```

## üß© Code breakdown

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)
```

We import:

* `fmt` ‚Äî for printing
* `sync` ‚Äî for synchronization tools (`WaitGroup`, `Mutex`)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Shared data and synchronization primitives

```go
var counter int
var wg sync.WaitGroup
var mu sync.Mutex
```

Here we declare three key variables:

| Variable  | Type             | Purpose                                           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `counter` | `int`            | Shared value accessed by multiple goroutines      |
| `wg`      | `sync.WaitGroup` | Waits for all goroutines to finish                |
| `mu`      | `sync.Mutex`     | Ensures mutual exclusion when accessing `counter` |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting number of goroutines

```go
numOfGoroutines := 5
wg.Add(numOfGoroutines)
```

We‚Äôll run **5 goroutines**, each incrementing the counter 1000 times.

So expected final result =
`5 √ó 1000 = 5000`.

`wg.Add(numOfGoroutines)` ensures the main goroutine knows to wait for **5 completions**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the increment function

```go
increment := func() {
	defer wg.Done()
	for range 1000 {
		mu.Lock()
		counter++
		mu.Unlock()
	}
}
```

Let‚Äôs dissect this line by line.

#### üî∏ `defer wg.Done()`

* Marks that when this goroutine finishes, it will signal the WaitGroup.
* So `wg.Wait()` in `main` knows one goroutine is done.

#### üî∏ `for range 1000`

* Loops 1000 times, so each goroutine performs 1000 increments.

#### üî∏ `mu.Lock()` and `mu.Unlock()`

* These are **critical section boundaries**.
* Only one goroutine can execute the code between them at a time.

Here‚Äôs what happens under the hood:

1. When a goroutine calls `mu.Lock()`, it **tries to acquire ownership** of that mutex.
2. If the mutex is already locked by another goroutine, this one will **pause (block)**.
3. When the owner calls `mu.Unlock()`, the mutex becomes available.
4. The waiting goroutine then wakes up, acquires the lock, increments `counter`, and unlocks again.

So effectively, only **one goroutine at a time** modifies `counter++`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Launching goroutines

```go
for range numOfGoroutines {
	go increment()
}
```

This launches 5 goroutines in parallel, all running the `increment` function.

So:

* Each goroutine does `1000` increments.
* Each increment operation is **protected by the same mutex**.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Waiting for all goroutines

```go
wg.Wait()
```

This makes the `main()` function **wait** until all 5 goroutines finish their 1000 increments.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Printing result

```go
fmt.Printf("‚úÖ Final counter val: %d\n", counter)
```

Once all increments complete, we print the final counter.

Since each of the 5 goroutines adds 1000, and all updates are protected by the mutex, the result is always:

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 5000
```

---

## üîê So‚Ä¶ how does the mutex ‚Äúknow‚Äù which value to protect?

Excellent question ‚Äî and this is subtle.

> The **mutex doesn‚Äôt automatically ‚Äúknow‚Äù** which variable it‚Äôs protecting.

### üß† Conceptually:

A mutex is like a **key** to a restricted area.
It doesn‚Äôt care what‚Äôs inside ‚Äî it just ensures that only one goroutine can enter that section of code at a time.

So in this example:

```go
mu.Lock()
counter++
mu.Unlock()
```

* The **critical section** is everything between `Lock()` and `Unlock()`.
* Since `counter++` happens inside this section, the mutex is effectively **protecting the counter**.

If you had this instead:

```go
mu.Lock()
x++
y++
mu.Unlock()
```

Then the same mutex would protect **both `x` and `y`**.

In short:

> The protection scope is determined by the **code block between Lock and Unlock**, not by the variable type or name.

### üß© Timeline visualization

Let‚Äôs see how goroutines take turns on the mutex:

| Time | Goroutine | Action                    |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| t1   | G1        | Lock ‚Üí Increment ‚Üí Unlock |
| t2   | G2        | Lock ‚Üí Increment ‚Üí Unlock |
| t3   | G3        | Lock ‚Üí Increment ‚Üí Unlock |
| t4   | G4        | Lock ‚Üí Increment ‚Üí Unlock |
| t5   | G5        | Lock ‚Üí Increment ‚Üí Unlock |

Even though they‚Äôre all running concurrently, the mutex **serializes** access to the shared variable.

---

### üßÆ Verification

Expected:

```
5 goroutines √ó 1000 increments = 5000
```

Output:

```
‚úÖ Final counter val: 5000
```

Always consistent ‚Äî because the mutex prevents any data races.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **mu.Lock() & mu.Unlock()** üîì

# Lock() vs Unlock() ‚Äî deep dive (Golang `sync.Mutex`)

Short version up front:

* `Lock()` **acquires** exclusive access to a mutex; if it‚Äôs already taken the caller **blocks** (waits) until it becomes available.
* `Unlock()` **releases** that exclusive access; if other goroutines are waiting, one (or more, depending on the runtime state) will wake and acquire the mutex.
  Together they form a synchronization pair that serializes access to whatever code or data we choose to protect.

---

# 1. What `Lock()` does (semantics)

* **Acquire exclusive access.** The caller enters the critical section only after `Lock()` returns successfully. While some other goroutine holds the mutex, `Lock()` will block.
* **Fast path vs contention:** In the uncontended case, `Lock()` typically succeeds via a cheap atomic compare-and-swap (CAS). Under contention the runtime may spin briefly (busy-wait) then park (sleep) the goroutine and schedule another when the lock is released.
* **Not reentrant.** `Lock()` is not reentrant: a goroutine that already holds the lock and calls `Lock()` again will block forever (deadlock).
* **No implicit ownership tracking.** The runtime does not associate a mutex with a specific goroutine for enforcement ‚Äî a mutex may be locked in one goroutine and unlocked in another (allowed by runtime), although that pattern is usually poor design and makes reasoning harder.
* **Memory ordering / happens-before:** A `Lock()` that observes a mutex after another goroutine‚Äôs `Unlock()` is guaranteed to see the memory writes made by that unlocking goroutine before it called `Unlock()`. In other words, `Unlock()` acts like a *release* and `Lock()` like an *acquire* ‚Äî they establish a happens-before relationship and provide visibility of previous writes.

---

# 2. What `Unlock()` does (semantics)

* **Release the mutex.** Makes it available to other waiters. If no goroutine is waiting, `Unlock()` simply marks the mutex unlocked.
* **Wakes waiters when necessary.** If there are goroutines parked waiting for the mutex, the runtime will wake one (or more, depending on starvation handling) so it can proceed and acquire the mutex.
* **Runtime checks / panics:** Calling `Unlock()` on an unlocked mutex triggers a runtime panic (e.g., `panic: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex`). So `Unlock()` must only be called when the mutex is currently locked.
* **Does not necessarily transfer ownership semantics.** Because Go doesn‚Äôt track owner identity, you *can* unlock from another goroutine ‚Äî the runtime won‚Äôt detect that ‚Äî but it‚Äôs generally confusing and risky unless you are intentionally implementing a handoff protocol.

---

# 3. Lock/Unlock and the Go memory model (visibility)

* **Writes before `Unlock()` are visible after a later `Lock()`.** If goroutine A does:

  ```go
  mu.Lock()
  x = 42
  mu.Unlock()
  ```

  and later goroutine B does:

  ```go
  mu.Lock()
  // sees x == 42
  mu.Unlock()
  ```

  then B is guaranteed to observe `x == 42`. That is the essential memory-visibility contract ‚Äî it makes mutexes useful for both mutual exclusion and synchronization.
* **Why this matters:** without such ordering, code could have subtle races even if we thought we synchronized. Lock/Unlock gives us *both* atomicity and visibility.

---

# 4. Implementation notes (what happens under the hood)

* **Fast uncontended path:** a single atomic operation succeeds and the goroutine proceeds with almost no overhead.
* **Spinning:** when contention appears, the runtime may spin for a few iterations on multicore systems to try to acquire the lock without going to the scheduler ‚Äî good for short critical sections.
* **Parking the goroutine:** if spinning doesn't help, the goroutine is parked (blocked) and removed from the run queue; waking it later requires scheduler work ‚Äî this is what makes contended locks expensive.
* **Starvation avoidance / handoff:** Go‚Äôs mutex has heuristics to avoid starving waiters: after enough failed attempts, the runtime may switch to a handoff mode where waiters are served more fairly. This means mutex acquisition is not strictly FIFO in normal mode (it can appear ‚Äúunfair‚Äù), but starvation is addressed by the runtime.

---

# 5. Correct usage patterns (idioms)

* **Always pair Lock/Unlock.** The idiomatic pattern is:

  ```go
  mu.Lock()
  defer mu.Unlock()
  // critical section
  ```

  `defer` ensures we always release the lock even if the function panics or returns early.
* **Prefer minimal critical sections.** Keep the code between Lock and Unlock as short as possible ‚Äî avoid I/O, blocking syscalls, network calls, or long computations while holding the mutex.
* **Use pointer receivers** for structs embedding a `sync.Mutex` and never copy such structs after use (copying a Mutex is a bug).
* **Avoid nested locks unless necessary.** If you must hold multiple locks simultaneously, document and enforce a global lock order to avoid deadlocks.

---

# 6. Common mistakes and their consequences

* **Double Lock (same goroutine):**

  ```go
  mu.Lock()
  mu.Lock() // deadlock ‚Äî will block forever
  ```

  Because the mutex isn‚Äôt reentrant, the second `Lock()` never returns.
* **Unlock when unlocked:**

  ```go
  var mu sync.Mutex
  mu.Unlock() // panic: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex
  ```
* **Copying the mutex** (embedding in a value that‚Äôs copied) leads to multiple copies of the same logical lock and breaks synchronization invariants. Always use pointers for types with mutexes.
* **Holding lock across blocking operations:** e.g., performing network calls, file IO, or calling into code that may block or take long ‚Äî this increases contention and risk of deadlock or poor performance.
* **Unlock from another goroutine (hand-off) without care:** it‚Äôs allowed, but can make analysis hard; use explicit handoff protocols or channels when possible.

---

# 7. `defer` placement and Unlock timing

* **Place `defer mu.Unlock()` immediately after `mu.Lock()`** to guarantee the unlock is registered even if subsequent code panics or returns early. If you register the `defer` *after* operations that might panic, you risk leaving the mutex locked forever.
* **Performance caveat:** `defer` has a small overhead. In extremely hot, tiny critical sections (very tight loops of millions of iterations), manually calling `mu.Unlock()` may be measurably faster ‚Äî but only optimize when profiling shows it‚Äôs necessary.

---

# 8. Differences vs other primitives

* **`sync.RWMutex`:** has `RLock()`/`RUnlock()` for many concurrent readers and `Lock()`/`Unlock()` for writers. Writers exclude readers and writers; readers exclude writers. Upgrading from RLock to Lock is not supported directly and is a source of complexity.
* **Atomics (`sync/atomic`):** for simple single-word counters or flags, atomics are usually faster and avoid scheduler involvement. Use atomics when the operation can be expressed safely with them.
* **Channels:** can be used for synchronization and handoff semantics; sometimes clearer and idiomatic (producer-consumer patterns).

---

# 9. Debugging and profiling

* **Race detector:** `go run -race` / `go test -race` detects unsynchronized access to shared memory. If we remove mutexes or misuse them, the race detector is the first tool to run.
* **pprof mutex profiles:** Go‚Äôs runtime can produce mutex contention profiles (via `runtime` and pprof) that show where goroutines spent time waiting for locks. Useful for finding hotspots.
* **Goroutine dumps (`panic` or `pprof`):** help locate goroutines stuck on `Lock()` or blocked because a mutex wasn‚Äôt released.

---

# 10. Examples & small scenarios

**Correct:**

```go
mu.Lock()
defer mu.Unlock()
x = x + 1
```

**Deadlock (double lock):**

```go
mu.Lock()
// ... do something ...
mu.Lock() // deadlock ‚Äî will block forever (not reentrant)
```

**Panic-safe with defer:**

```go
mu.Lock()
defer mu.Unlock()
doSomething() // if this panics, Unlock still runs
```

**Unlocking an unlocked mutex (panic):**

```go
mu.Unlock() // runtime panic
```

**Handoff pattern (allowed, but be careful):**

```go
// Goroutine A
mu.Lock()
// do something
go func() {
    // goroutine B will call mu.Unlock() - allowed but hard to reason about
}()
```

---

# 11. Practical checklist (what we should do)

* Use `mu.Lock()` + `defer mu.Unlock()` immediately after locking.
* Keep critical sections tiny and avoid blocking operations while holding a lock.
* Use `sync/atomic` for hot counters when applicable.
* Run the race detector during development.
* Don‚Äôt copy structs that embed mutexes. Use pointer receivers.
* If you need handoff semantics, consider channels or document the handoff clearly.
* Profile for contention (pprof) before making complicated sharding/lock-splitting changes.
